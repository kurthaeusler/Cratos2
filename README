A decade ago we had an anonymous chat server at work called Cratos. It was a
lot of fun. This is an attempt to recreate something like that.
I can't take much credit for this, I copied it mostly from here:
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Implement_a_chat_server

I just had to make a small change to make it work with the new exceptions
introduced in GHC, and I removed the names, greet and part messages etc,
